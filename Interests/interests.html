            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am about to graduate from UCL, where I studied a master's in Energy Systems and Data Analytics.
                 While the course focuses on the energy transition, it primarily teaches the fundamentals of Data Science. 
                 This includes the basics of the end-to-end data processing pipeline: collection, cleaning, modelling, analysis, 
                 and presentation of results.</p>
            <p>Through this course, I developed a passion for handling data, tackling complex issues, and delivering solutions to real-world problems. However, this master's has only provided a baseline. To further enhance my skills, I have independently learned SQL and basic AWS to complement my classroom education.</p>
            <p>I also have a keen interest in the financial sector. I regularly read the latest stories from the FT and listen to their podcasts, along with the BBC World Business Report and The Economist podcasts. I find geopolitical issues fascinating, especially how changes at the top have significant ripple effects.</p>
            <h2>Why I Am Interested in Solving Actuarial Problems</h2>
            <p>My interest in a career in insurance began during the Californian wildfires. The immense damage caused by increasingly powerful natural events has catastrophic impacts on the economy, highlighting the crucial role of the insurance market in mitigating these risks.</p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in the insurance of large-scale energy, aviation, or manufacturing sectors, where my previous experience and interests remain relevant. While this is a long-term goal, my primary aim for the next few years is to gain experience in the actuarial field, developing the key skills and background knowledge necessary for a successful career.</p>
            <p>My background in engineering and data analytics equips me with a strong foundation for tackling actuarial problems. My analytical skills, combined with my experience in handling complex datasets, enable me to approach risk assessment and statistical analysis with precision. Additionally, my ability to work collaboratively with external teams and consultants positions me well for the multidisciplinary nature of actuarial work.</p>
            <h2>Previous Engineering Background</h2>
            <p>I have an engineering background, having first completed a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering. Afterward, I took an entry-level role as a Research and Development Engineer at a medium-sized engineering company. During this role, I worked extensively with consultants and other external teams, which I particularly enjoyed. This exposure allowed me to learn from experienced professionals in related fields, and I am eager to continue this type of collaborative work.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy through-hiking and have completed a 17-day trip crossing the Swiss Alps. With a background in climbing, I am eager to delve further into mountaineering and plan to undertake glacier training in the near future.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy running and rowing, which help me stay active and maintain a balanced lifestyle. These activities not only provide physical challenges but also allow me to set and achieve personal goals, something I value in all aspects of my life.</p>
