                    <p> This project aimed to identify the key locations for HGV charging points along the British key motorways and A-roads, as 
                        well as propose a suggested quantity of installations to meet the requirements. <br><br>
                        
                        This paper used the road freight 
                        goods lifted dataset <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/rfs01-goods-lifted-and-distance-hauled">(RFS0123)</a> 
                        from gov.uk to weight the locations determined as key, to establish a priority list for the installation of HGV charging points.<br><br>

                        Plotting of the routes were formed via the use of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview">Google Maps API.</a> <br><br>

                        The results could inform policymakers about the strategic investments required to support the electrification of HGV fleets.  </p>

                    <p>
                       The model was constructed as a combination of a series of scenarios: <br><br>
                        
                       <ol>
                        <li>One way route, starting fully charged and charging once on route</li>
                        <li>Return journey starting fully charged and returning with one charge</li>
                        <li>Return journey starting fully charged and returning with 2 charges at the same station</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    The reason only one station was modelled, was due to complexity of the model. Running with multiple stations would have significantly increased 
                    the time taken to run the model, for little impact due to the lack of trade between the missing locations. <br><br>

                        These results clearly indicate the key locations for HGV charging points. Should every HGV be replaced with eHGV's, The locations with the highest demand
                         at peak hour are shown in <strong>Figure 4</strong>. A graph showing their geographical position <strong>Figure 5</strong> was created, to ease comprehension. <br><br>

                         To improve this model, a larger dataset would be required. This time showing the orgin/destination in higher resolution. This could be paired with a forecast
                        of future freight movement, to produce a model that would definitively calculate the optimal locations. <br><br>,
