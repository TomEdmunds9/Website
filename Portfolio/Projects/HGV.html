                    <h1 class="title">Optimal HGV charging locations</h1>
                    <p> This project aimed to identify the key locations for HGV charging points along the British key motorways and A-roads, as 
                        well as propose a suggested quantity of installations to meet the requirements. <br><br>
                        
                        This project  used the road freight 
                        goods lifted dataset <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/rfs01-goods-lifted-and-distance-hauled">(RFS0123)</a> 
                        from gov.uk to weight the locations determined as key, to establish a priority list for the installation of HGV charging points.<br><br>

                        Plotting of the routes were formed via the use of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview">Google Maps API.</a> <br><br>

                        The results could inform policymakers about the strategic investments required to support the electrification of HGV fleets. <br><br>

                        Note: This is a highly condensed form of the project, If you are interested I will happily talk about it in more detail. I have not fully explained the assumptions, but they are well grounded.

                    <p>
                        My first step in the project was to collect and explore the data. To do this a series of graphs were made to visualise the data gathered<br><br>
                        
                        The locations from road freight goods lifted dataset represent the origin/destination for all trips in this model. To view this, I 
                        used the Google maps api to get locational data for each location and then plotted them on a map. <br><br>

                        Using the API the name and locations of all service stations was also gathered and then plotted over the Highway road map from OSMnx, 
                        as shown in <strong> Figure 1</strong>. <br><br>
                        

                        <strong> Figure 2</strong> below shows the distance goods are hauled across the UK. As expected most goods are moved within the region, in 
                        short trips. Giving the large value for Zero. Excluding that there is a slightly skewed distribution with a mode around 150km

                    <p> <strong> Figure 3</strong> shows the weight of goods moved between origin and destination, also showing the possible routes that could be modelled. 
                        It shows the while most goods are moved within the region, there are a few regions trading heavily with one another. <br><br>

                                                
                        The matrix is not symmetrical, with some regions recieving more goods than shipping and vice versa.

                    <p> This matrix will be used to weight the final results. By using the weight of good travelled, we can estimate the number of trips. 
                        From number of trips (and stopping points used), I can determine the priority locations for HGV charging points. <br><br>

                        To model the movement of goods across the UK, I used the Google Maps API to plot the routes between the origin and destination 
                        of the goods lifted. This returned the distance and time taken to travel between the two points. <br><br>
                        
                        Most return journeys, from origin to destination, will require a charge. However, 26% of journeys are too short 
                        and a further 3% were too far to be done with one charge alone.  <br><br>

                        Using the time taken to travel between the two points, I can remove all the trips that don't require a charge. 
                        When plotted on a map, <strong> Figure 4</strong> is created. This shows the locations most imporatant for HGV travel.

                    <p>
                       The model was constructed as a combination of a series of scenarios: <br><br>
                        
                       <ol>
                        <li>One way route, starting fully charged and charging once on route</li>
                        <li>Return journey starting fully charged and returning with one charge</li>
                        <li>Return journey starting fully charged and returning with 2 charges at the same station</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    The reason only one station was modelled, was due to complexity of the model. Running with multiple stations would have significantly increased 
                    the time taken to run the model, for little impact due to the lack of trade between the missing locations. <br><br>

                        These results clearly indicate the key locations for HGV charging points. Should every HGV be replaced with eHGV's, The locations with the highest demand
                         at peak hour are shown in <strong>Figure 4</strong>. A graph showing their geographical position <strong>Figure 5</strong> was created, to ease comprehension. <br><br>

                         To improve this model, a larger dataset would be required. This time showing the orgin/destination in higher resolution. This could be paired with a forecast
                        of future freight movement, to produce a model that would definitively calculate the optimal locations. <br><br>
