                    <p> 
                        This paper would like to present the analysis for an alternative method of increasing the energy performance 
                        of public buildings in England and Wales. Instead of providing large funding packages to specific institutions, 
                        a programme of common changes will be made to all public buildings across the country, where applicable by Display 
                        Energy Certificate (DEC) recommendations. This plan will focus on selecting the common changes which can be implemented 
                        quickly for high CO2 reduction. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The DEC shows the energy performance of a building based on actual energy consumption as recorded over the last 12 months. 
                        It applies to any building with more than 250m^2 of usable floor space that is occupied in whole or part by public authorities 
                        and frequently visited by the public.

                        <br><br>
                        By analysing the DEC rating data from the UK Government Department of levelling up, housing and communities 
                        (epc.opendatacommunities.org, 2024) this paper aims to:

                    	<li>Provide an overview of the state of public buildings energy efficiency in England and Wales.</li>
                        <li>Determine which of the suggested improvements government action should focus on.</li>

                        <br>
                        Note: This is a highly condensed form of the project, If you are interested I will happily talk about it in more detail. 
                        I have not fully explained the assumptions, but they are well grounded.

                        Due to the vast number of suggestions, this paper only considers suggestions that had a ‘high’ 
                        CO2 impact ranking with a short payback time, either labelled as short or other in the original data. 
                        A total of 166,987 suggestions to examine.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The recommendations were either a preset recommendation or a custom suggestion by the inspector. <strong>Figure 1</strong> 
                        shows a graph the top 16 recommendation codes used by inspectors, with full list in Table 1.  
                        Importantly, there were around 60,000 custom suggestions along with 60 different preset recommendations.
